									<h1>About Me</h1>
									<p>Hi, my name is Adam Sadov, I am data science student<br />
									at <a href="https://www.brooklyn.edu/">Brooklyn College</a>. I have currently started my new position as a SWE Fellow at <a href="https://headstarter.co/">Headstarter AI</a>,<br />
									where I will be working with a team to create 5 <strong>amazing</strong> AI projects over the next 7 weeks.</p>

								<p>Since I was a young child, I've always wanted to be a sort of business man. I looked up to the flashy people in suits who always had a phone against their ear and briefcase beside their waist. For years I wanted to do something to make me a part of their world. Throughout school, especially college, I realized I had a knack for maths and technology and inevitably picked up programming from that. I had learned a lot about and had experience with finances, data, the stock market, etc. I needed a career path where I can apply my mathematical and analytical skills while also having the ability to create things and guide others. Ever since then, I have been practicing and applying my skills daily to pursue a career as an exceptional data scientist. With the recent changes and news around AI and its forseeable capabilities, I've dedicated myself to specalize in machine learning and AI modeling to expand my skillset and build more complex algorithms. I want to prove to my younger self that you don't need a flashy suit to be a part of that world, you just need desire, and the drive to claim your spot for the future.</p>
								<p>I spend a lot of my time working, studying, playing piano, playing video games, and exercising. You'll find me most mornings at the gym, and most evenings in my room watching how to web scrape in python or how to make millions off trading options. Playing piano is one of these things that I am most passionate about. I mostly enjoy playing classical pieces. It's a creative outlet that gives me balance to my structure-dependent life. Although its a simple routine, its unqiuely fulfilling. Each and every one of these parts of my daily life contributes to my progress, my growth, and who I aspire to be.</p>
